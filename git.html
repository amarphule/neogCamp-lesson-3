      <h1>Git Version Control</h1>
      <small>Created on Sep 22, 2021</small>
      <h4>Version Control:</h4>
      <p>
        In simple words, a version means a record(track). In terms of software
        coding, developers need to manage records or track programs, documents,
        and other collections of information. The process which is used to
        control this system is called the Version control system.
      </p>
      <p>
        The version control system is designed to maintain record changes within
        one or more files over time. It maintains records like who, when, and
        what changes were made. We can compare one file to the previous or next
        version of the file to check who, when what change we made. We can also
        revert the back and change file.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why I am mentioning the file instead of code? Because Git is a free and
        distributed version control system. It can be used to control all types
        of files like video, audio, word, excel sheets, images..etc Version
        control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a
        special kind of database. If something goes wrong, developers can go
        back and compare earlier versions of the code to fix the mistake while
        minimizing disruption to all team members.
      </p>
      <h4>Types are 3 of version control system</h4>
      <details>
        <summary># Local Version Control System:-</summary>
        <p>
          - This is the simplest form of the version control system. It is a
          local database located on your local machine. in which every file
          change is stored as a patch.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary># Centralized Version Control System:-</summary>
        <p>
          - Centralized version control systems are based on the idea that there
          is a single central copy of your code somewhere on the server and
          coders will commit their changes to this central code.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary># Distributed Version Control System:-</summary>
        <p>
          - Distributed version control system is a type of version control
          where the complete code base including its complete history is
          mirrored on every coder's computer.
